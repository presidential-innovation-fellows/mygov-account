              MyGov began its journey by setting out to improve the way citizens interact with government, but to continue, we need your help. The code is just the start. It is our hope that these MyGov projects can serve as one example of a greater joint effort - citizens and government collaborating to improve our shared experience, and there are lots of ways to do just that.
            %p
              Virtually all of the functionality available via MyGov is exposed in a machine readable format, and we encourage developers to build cool things using them. Already built something cool? (We'd love to hear about it).

              The MyGov Discovery <abbr>API</abbr> provides a service to discover related government content. Think of it as a folksonomy layered on top of the entire .gov footprint. Each page is assigned tags, which are used to find similarly tagged pages.

              Project MyGov is a series of open source projects and is supported by the efforts of an entire community. Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can spare, your contribution is greatly appreciated. As with all open source software, feel free to adapt the code for your own projects, but with this code especially, we encourage you to take a moment to get involved.
